Description: Provide early termination phase II trial designs with a
    decreasingly informative prior (DIP) or a regular Bayesian prior
    chosen by the user. The program can determine the minimum planned
    sample size necessary to achieve the user-specified admissible
    designs. The program can also perform power and expected sample size
    calculations for the tests in early termination Phase II trials.
